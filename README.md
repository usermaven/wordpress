## Why Usermaven?
Most firms try to use complex and expensive analytics platforms like Mixpanel or Amplitude but never get around to properly configuring them to get meaningful insights. You need a product analytics solution that's easy to setup and has ready-made templates to generate actionable insights for making data-backed growth decisions.

That's why we built Usermaven, the new data scientist in your team. We are making product analytics affordable, easy to setup and simple to maintain.

- **Super Simple** – Designed to be simple and intuitive in every way, without complexity or clutter to distract you. WooCommerce events are tracked automatically with zero configuration needed.
- **Privacy Compliance** – We've designed Usermaven to comply with GDPR and CCPA regulations from day one.
- **System Security** – We apply the latest security standards and take measures to ensure your data is safe with us.

## Installation
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Usermaven, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New". In the search field type "Usermaven" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

## Tracking identified users
If a `$current_user` is present, and `Identify logged-in users in Useramven` option is enabled, then we will automatically identify your logged-in users.
